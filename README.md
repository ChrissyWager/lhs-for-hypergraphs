# lhs-for-hypergraphs
Investigation into the possibilities of using Locality Sensitive Hashing schemes to aid in the partition of hypergraphs.

A shortlist consisting of the following LHS schemes was chosen for comparison:
- Densifying One Permutation Hashing (of the MinHash family)
- ProbMinHash (3a specifically) (also of the MinHash family)
- SimHash (of the family that uses Cosine Similarity)
- Random Projections LSH (also of the family that uses Cosine Similarity)
- P-Stable LSH (using Euclidean Distance)
- Original Locality Sensitive Hashing (bit-wise, using Hamming Distance)
